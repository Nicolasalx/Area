## Conclusion

Where React shine by its component system, the promess of Flutter and .Net's Cross platform seems more advantageous to offer our application to a wider range of users.

Flutter allows to visualise in realtime the changes made to the application, rendering the code easier to understand, and Dart easier to approach.

I thereby recommand the use of Flutter for our mobile app development.
